# Overview

This repository contains a **node.js** project for a simple **markdown** based wiki.

To use this wiki in a production environment you have to deploy it to a node hoster like **azure** or **heroku**.

It uses currently 2 git-repositories. The first repository contains the source code and is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/janbaer/mdwiki). 
You can clone or fork it from here. Contributors are welcome!

The second repository contains the content of your wiki. It's your personal repository. 

We are planning to integrate you content as an read only (in the first version) git repository within the distributed web application.

In the first version you have the create a clone and pull the updates manually over the web fronent. 

For the next milestone we are planning to use web hooks to receive all updates automatically.

For more informations about the project see the wiki page of this repository. We will write more technical informations about the project there.
